Vagrant is a configuration manager for the VMs installed and controlled by the hypervisor which allocates the CPU, RAM and Disk space per VM. Vagrant controls the configuration through a single file for multiple VMs and this file is called vagrantfile; inside the vagrant file is a list of commands divided into 3 parts, providers (e.g. VirtualBox) and the os image (The type of OS you will be running) and lastly, provisioning, meaning how will you deploy those configuration (e.g. Custom shell script, Ruby, Go, Puppet, Ansible). After the vagrant file is setup all you need is vagrant up and all your virtual machines will start at once. Why Vagrant? Because it allows you to configure multiple VMs at once, let's say you have been tasked with configuring multiple VMs running diff or the same OS and that task is also repititive, wouldn't be easier to centralize all your work in just one place???
